Aside from learning to draw triangles and, by extension, regular polygons, this project is a learning experience because I am using the new rendering system provided by SDL which includes drawing lines as well.

There are other things I need to learn such as the difference between surfaces and textures and how they interact.

This folder contains the latest source I am working on which will be similar to my examples folder but perhaps more up to date but not as polished.
